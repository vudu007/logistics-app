**3. Push and Redeploy**
1.  Run these commands in your **PowerShell** (if you haven't already):
    ```powershell
    git add .
    git commit -m "Final fixes and updated requirements"
    git push
    ```
2.  Go to your **Render Dashboard**.
3.  Click on your **`logistics-pro`** Web Service.
4.  Click **"Manually Deploy New Version"** or check the **"Auto-Deploy"** setting to see if it triggered automatically.

The error you saw (`Internal Server Error` on the live site) means Render is running the build command, but Python is crashing when trying to initialize Flask/SQLAlchemy. The hybrid database config in `app.py` should automatically select PostgreSQL when it sees the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable provided by Render, which requires `psycopg2-binary` to be present in your `requirements.txt`.
